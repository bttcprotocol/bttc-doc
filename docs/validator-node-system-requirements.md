# Validator Node System Requirements


## Overview

The system requirements listed in this section are both for the sentry node and the validator node.

The *minimum* system requirements mean you can run the nodes but the setup is not future-proof.

The *recommended* system requirements mean the nodes are future-proof. There is, however, no upper limit to future-proofing your nodes.

You must always run the sentry node and the validator node on separate machines.

## Minimum system requirements

* RAM: 32 GB
* CPU: 8-core
* Storage: 1 TB SSD

:::note

For Amazon Web Services (AWS), the equivalent of the minimum requirements instances are **m5d.2xlarge** or **t3.2xlarge** with unlimited credits selected.

For storage, make sure the 1 TB SSD storage is extendable.

:::

## Recommended system requirements

* RAM: 64 GB
* CPU: 16-core
* Storage: 1 TB SSD
* Bandwidth: 1 Gbit/s

:::note

For Amazon Web Services (AWS), the equivalent of the recommended requirements instance is **m5d.4xlarge**.

For OVH, the equivalent of the recommended requirements instance is **infra-3**.

For network, expect 3-5 TB of data transferred per month.
