# BTTC Testnet

The BitTorrent Chain (BTTC) test network is open now. Currently, it supports TRON Nile testnet, Ethereum Goerli testnet and the BSC testnet. The introduction is as follows:

| Chain  |  Test network name |  URL |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| TRON  | Nile  |  [Nile Faucet](https://testfaucet.bt.io/#/tron) |
|  ETH |  Goerli | [Goerli Faucet](https://faucet.goerli.mudit.blog/)  |
|  BSC |  BSC Testnet | [BSC Faucet](https://testnet.binance.org/faucet-smart)  |
|  BTTC | BitTorrent Chain Donau | [Donau Faucet](https://testfaucet.bt.io/#)  |

## TRON Nile Testnet

The access to the Tron Nile testnet requires the Tronlink Chrome plug-in, and Tronlink already supports Nile.

After logging in to the Tronlink wallet, users need to switch to the Nile testnet, apply for a test coin through the faucet with a Tronlink account to complete the Nile testnet environment configuration.

* Faucet: https://testfaucet.bt.io/#/tron
* Official website: https://nileex.io/
* Block explorer: https://nile.tronscan.org/
* Status: ​​https://nileex.io/status/getStatusPage

## ETH Goerli Testnet

Accessing to the Goerli testnet requires Metamask. Please switch to the Goerli testnet, apply for a test coin and send it to the Metamask account to complete the preparation of the Goerli testnet configuration.

If Metamask has not yet connected to the Goerli test network, you need to add a custom RPC network to Metamask, with the following parameters:

* Network Name: Goerli - Testnet
* RPC URL: https://goerli.infura.io/v3/9aa3d95b3bc440fa88ea12eaa4456161
* ChainID: 5
* Symbol: ETH
* Block Explorer URL: https://goerli.etherscan.com

## BSC Testnet

Accessing to the BSC testnet requires Metamask. Please switch to the Goerli test network, apply for a test coin through the faucet and send it to the Metamask account to complete the configuration of the BSC test network environment.

If Metamask has not been connected to the BSC testnet yet, you need to add a custom RPC network to Metamask. The parameters are as follows:

* Network Name: Binace Smart Chain - Testnet
* RPC URL: https://data-seed-prebsc-1-s1.binance.org:8545/
* ChainID: 97
* Symbol: BNB
* Block Explorer URL: https://testnet.bscscan.com
